# CSS

## Part 1 - Responsive - index.html and main.css
You will find existing markup in box index.html and main.css.  You can modify the HTML and CSS as you see fit.

### Goal
Write CSS to fulfill each one of these scenarios. 

 - Between 0 and 575px all `.item` element should be in one column
 - Between 576px and 767px, the `.item` elements should form in two columns
 - Above 769px all `.item` elements should appear on the same line (4 columns)

### Approach 1 - Vanilla CSS
Meet the requirements writing vanilla css.


### Approach 2 - Bootstrap
Use Bootstrap's build in classes to achieve the goal, BUT you must convert each `.item` to use Bootstrap's card component classes.

## Part 2 - Questions - question.css
Do your best to answer the three questions in `questions.css`


## Part 3 - SCSS - convert.scss
Using our past slides as documentation, convert the CSS in `convert.scss` into more functional SCSS.  You should convert it to use nesting, variables, and the parent selector.
